# Health Card Generator Using RFID

A smart healthcare solution that utilizes RFID cards and a reader to store and access patient information securely and efficiently. This project is built using Python and Django for the backend, MySQL for data storage, and PHP for RFID data handling.

## 🩺 Project Overview

This system allows healthcare providers to:

- Store patients' medical information directly on RFID cards.
- Read and write patient data using RFID card readers.
- Integrate a secure Django-based web interface for managing data.
- Use PHP scripts to interface with RFID hardware and MySQL database.

## 📌 Features

- Patient registration and health record management.
- RFID read/write integration with card readers.
- Secure web interface for hospitals/doctors.
- Real-time access to patient data using RFID scan.
- Backend API in Django.
- PHP scripts for interacting with RFID hardware.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Django**
- **MySQL**
- **PHP**
- **RFID RC522 Reader/Writer**
- **MFRC522 Python Library**
- **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap** (for frontend templates)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PHP
- MySQL
- Django (`pip install django`)
- RFID RC522 hardware
- MFRC522 Python library (`pip install mfrc522` or use source)


##🛡️ Security Notes
Ensure patient data is encrypted before writing to RFID cards.

Limit access to RFID writing endpoints (both PHP and Django).

Use HTTPS for deployment.

##🧪 Future Improvements
Integration with cloud database for distributed access.

Face recognition alongside RFID for dual authentication.

Mobile app integration for emergency access.
